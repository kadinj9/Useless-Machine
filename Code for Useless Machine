/* This is a code written for a "Useless Machine." This code requries a SINGLE POLE DOUBLE THROW switch to be used, TWO 10K RESISTORS going from GROUND to ON pin and OFF pin and a MicroServo that is only capable of +- 180 degrees
This code is designed to randomly move the arm on the "Useless Machine." It will sometimes center the switch, sometimes move the switch all the Off Position. Sometimes it just might move around randomly. Who knows?
This code requires the Servo libary. Can be found at https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Servo
